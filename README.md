# Morse_Code_Translator

<img src="images/morseCodeRobot.png" width="400" height="400">

For our final course project, we built a robot that can draw and read morse code. 

## Robot Tasks

1. Wait for left or right button input 
2. Upon left button press, drives forward until reaches black for the first time 
3. Starts reading the morse code 
4. Ends the reading when reaches red 
2. Upon right button press, opens and read the file 
3. Translates the words to morse code 
4. Draws out the morse code using 1 cm increments based on the following rules: 1 cm for a dot, 3 cm for a dash, 
   1 cm between dots and dashes in the same letter, 3 cm between letters 
5. Stops when done writing 
6. If the enter button is held, the shutdown procedure will activate.  


## Roles

Olivia: 
• programmed 

## Code

The robot was programmed using Robot C (The syntax is very similar to C++).

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
